Introduction
------------
Unearths one or more artifacts about a Mac. Run it standalone to output to `stdout`; import it into your own scripts; use it with the `--jss` argument to work it into a Jamf Extension Attribute.

Usage
-----

    usage: unearth [-h] [--list] [--version] [--jss [[...]]] [--quiet [[...]]] ...

    Returns one or more artifacts about this Mac

    positional arguments:
    remnants

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --list, -l            list categories
    --version, -v         show the version number
    --jss [ [ ...]], -j [ [ ...]]
                            return in jss format
    --quiet [ [ ...]], -q [ [ ...]]
                            return only the values

Examples
--------

    $ ./unearth primary_interface console_user battery_percentage
    battery_percentage => 65
    console_user => chilcote
    primary_interface => en0

    $ ./unearth --quiet primary_interface console_user battery_percentage
    65
    chilcote
    en0

    $ ./unearth --jss primary_interface console_user battery_percentage
    <result>65
    chilcote
    en0</result>

Excavate Module
----------------
If you wish, you may import the `Excavate()` module into your very own python scripts:

    >>> from excavate import Excavate
    >>> artifacts = Excavate()
    >>> gimme_artifacts = artifacts.get(['primary_interface', 'console_user', 'battery_percentage'])
    >>> print gimme_artifacts
    {'battery_percentage': '70', 'console_user': u'chilcote', 'primary_interface': u'en0'}

Adding Artifacts
------------

Add your own modules that `artifacts` subdirectory. They must have a `fact()` function that returns a dictionary of keys and values.

    factoid = 'favorite_book'

    def fact():
        '''Returns my favorite book'''
        return {factoid: ['John Kennedy Toole', 'A Confederacy of Dunces']}

About
-----
Some of these facts are taken from the [godawful pyfacts script](https://github.com/chilcote/pylab/blob/master/pyfacts) I've failed to maintain for the past few years.

I've wanted to break these up into modules for a long time. Inspiration came via the inimitable Greg Neagle's vastly more hip [munki-facts](https://github.com/munki/munki-facts) scripts. My apologies to Greg for once again bastardizing his code, and again I thank him for resisting the urge to put out a restraining order on me. As an offering of good faith, all of the facts herein are of a standard format and should work within `munki-facts`.
